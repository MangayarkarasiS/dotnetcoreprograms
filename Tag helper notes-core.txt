Tag helpers:

Html code to create hyperlink:
<a href="home/Details/1" >View</a>
<a href="home/Details/@employee.Id" >View</a>

Tag helper code:

<a asp-controller="home" asp-action="Details" asp-route-Id>View</a>

Eventhough html code seems to be easy than Tag helper the use of it is when in route .config file 
we change the path like = "student/{controller=home}/{action=Details}/@parameter"

her in html student will not get reflected and it will throw 404 error. whereas taghelper it will automatically at runtime update the link that is given in route.config file

This is the advantage of Tag helper over traditional HTML

Image tag helper:
*******************

When we give our HTML img element - the src attribute will serve the image from its folder
Now if i go for changing the image inside the file, but name is same 

i.e flower image is present in flower.jpeg file
now i change the image to teddy instead of flower, without changing the name of file, 
then what will happen is same flower image will be displayed instead of teddy, 
this is because it is cached by browser. so we have to disable cache by clicking f12 
and goto network option and check disable cache, so that it will get from server.

But by doing this performance will be a issue since instead of taking from cache , it takes everytime from server.

So to overcome this, think if we have an option like if image changes it has to go to server or otherwise take it from cache.
This is acheived by using img tag helper
<img src="~/images/flower.jpeg" asp-append-version="true"/>

how this works - it creates a hash code which changes when image changes or remains the same.


Environment tag helper:
***************************
It sets the environment
