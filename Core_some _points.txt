wwwroot - 
1. store static files and it can be accessed only from these folders. so don't go for creating it outside of the folder
2. this folder can be renamed and the new name should be included in main method as .UseWebRoot("Content") if wwroot is changed to content

****************
program.cs

1. asp.net core is a console project
2. it starts executing from Main class
3. we can create host for the application from here(which has pre configured defaults)
4. CreateDefaultBuilder() configures Kestrel, IISIntegration and other configurations

Kestrel:

5. Kestrel is an open-source, cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core. 6. It is designed to be used behind proxy because it has not yet matured to be exposed as a full-fledge web server.
7. Kestrel calls ConfigureAppConfiguration() - to load configurations from appsettings.json files, environment variables and user secrets. 

*******************
startup.cs

1. used instead of global.asax file
2. Its executed when application starts
3. configured using  .UseStartup() in host
4. we can change the name inside usestartup()
5. Startup class includes two public methods: ConfigureServices(optional) and Configure.

configure services:
------------------------------
6. The ConfigureServices method is a place where you can register your dependent classes
7. After registering dependent class, it can be used anywhere in the application. 
8. You just need to include it in the parameter of the constructor of a class
9. IOc container will automatically inject it
10. ASP.NET Core refers dependent class as a Service.(means it is going to be used in some other class)

Configure():
----------------
1. configure application request pipeline for your application using IApplicationBuilder
2. middleware components to define a request pipeline, which will get executed on every request

1. configure services method is called before configure,
2.  so that you can register your custom service with the IoC container which you may use in the Configure method.
